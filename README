Notes About This Repository
---------------------------

There is a new netwmpager 2.x for download at http://sourceforge.net/projects/sf-xpaint/files/netwmpager/. But this version doesn't work for me as good as older 1.11 and I don't have enough patience for investigation why. I tried a lot with the config file but I wasn't successful in several hours.

The original Timo's netwmpager website http://onion.dynserv.net/~timo/netwmpager.html doesn't exist any more (still available at http://web.archive.org/) and the 1.11 tarbal is disappearing from the web, so I decided to backup the code publicly on GitHub. I had its copy on my disk and I found https://github.com/Youx/netwmpager with the same content. The license is GPL so everything should be OK. Netwmpager 1.11 already do everything I need so I plan no big improvements of the code at the moment.
